  |   Beholder, the narrative award-winning dark dystopian adventure is     |
  |   now on Nintendo Switch!                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Have you ever dreamed of being a landlord in a totalitarian state,    |
  |   so you can spy and report everyone? Well, it is now possible thanks   |
  |   to Beholder and its original 2D gameplay mixing management and        |
  |   spying mechanics with a choice-driven narrative.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In this grim dystopian future, where privacy is dead and the State    |
  |   controls every aspect of life, will you choose to cling to your       |
  |   humanity or to be a ruthless landlord? In either case, prepare to     |
  |   be unsettled.                                                         |

  |   To your tenants, you are Carl Stein, a government-installed           |
  |   landlord. However, that is simply a facade that hides your real       |
  |   mission: to covertly spy on your tenants. An experimental drug        |
  |   suppressing the need of sleep was injected to you during your         |
  |   medical exam, so you will have more time to serve your motherland.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Inspired by George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Ray Bradbury books,      |
  |   Beholder will challenge your mind and ethics as every choice will     |
  |   have a consequence.                                                   |
